# Livecoding: React Router and API

This is a bare example on how to use an API with React and React Router.

This project uses the free [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/) to fetch information about Ghibli movies.

## How to Use

This app was created with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). All the usual scripts apply:

```bash
npm start
```

## Endpoints

- `/`: Displays all the Ghibli movies (`FilmsList`)
- `/film/:filmId`: Displays a movie details (`FilmDetails`)
